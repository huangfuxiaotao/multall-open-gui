# multall-open-gui
 An aerospace undergraduate senior project to create a GUI for the multall-open suite.

Included:

- Multall GUI v4.exe
- stagen-18.1.exe and dependencies for plotting stagen.dat
- plotall-17.1.exe and dependencies for plotting flow.out
- Modified multall-open suite for automation
- This README.txt

===========================================================================

If the program does not run, most likely you are missing these:

Windows Requirements: 

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 (!)Required
- Intel Fortran Compiler suite

Linux/macOS Requirements:

- Use pyinstaller to compile a Linux/macOS executable or contact me.
- gfortran

===========================================================================

NOTICE: The GUI only works up to the stage 1 tab right now!

Please read the console output when running the program.

Use stagen-18.1.exe and plotall-17.1.exe to create plots. Built in plotting in the future? Probably not.
